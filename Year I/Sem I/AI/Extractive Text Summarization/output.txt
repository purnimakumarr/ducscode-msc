Article 2 - Like an old club, set members don't want to let go of the grip: Jaishankar targets UNSC

Extractive Text Summarization
Input text:  NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday took a jibe at the United Nations Security Council saying that it is like an "old club" where member nations are unwilling to admit new members. Addressing an event at the Rotary Institute 2023 in Bengaluru, Jaishankar remarked that the "club" members prefer not to have their methods scrutinized. "Security Council is like an old club, where there are set members who don't want to let go of the grip. They want to keep control over the club. Not very keen to admit more members, not keen to have their practices questioned," Jaishankar said. The Union minister highlighted that the UN's diminishing effectiveness due to the absence of reforms is a concerning issue. "In a way, it's a human failing. But I think today it is harming the world. It is harming the world because, on key issues confronting the world, the UN is getting less and less effective," Jaishankar said. "And I can also tell you the global sentiment. I mean, today, if you ask 200 countries in the world, do you want reform or don't you want reform? A very large number of countries would say, yes, we want reform," he added. Earlier this year, Jaishankar had said that the United Nations no longer reflected the reality of the world and was in need of reforms. "It is really a bit like a company. It is like the shareholders have changed, but the management has not. So, there are the new shareholders who want fair management, but the old guys don't want to let go. This issue is not going to be easily resolved, but with each passing day, the pressure is building," the minister had said, while speaking at the 'G20 Festival of Thinkers Summit' organized by the Symbiosis International (Deemed University). During his concluding address at the G20 Leaders Summit in the national capital, PM Modi reiterated his stance of making global systems in accordance with the "realities of the present" and took the example of the United Nations Security Council. "When the UN was established, the world at that time was completely different from today. At that time there were 51 founding members in the UN. Today the number of countries included in the UN is around 200. Despite this, the permanent members in UNSC are still the same," the Prime Minister had underlined.

Article 5 - Indian Railways can help save Rs 1.28 lakh crore annually in diesel costs with its freight & cargo hauling: Ashwini Vaishnaw

Extractive Text Summarization
Input text:  Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that India can potentially save Rs 1.28 lakh crore annually in diesel costs by 2031 if it successfully transports an additional 1500 million tonnes of cargo through trains. Speaking at the 68th National Railways Awards, Vaishnaw stated that India's economic growth is expected to result in an additional 3000 million tonnes of cargo being moved within the country by 2031. According to the minister, Indian Railways is on track to capture half of this incremental cargo growth, resulting in a reduction of 16,000 crore litres of diesel consumption each year. This would translate to an annual savings of Rs 1.28 lakh crore for India, he was quoted as saying by ET. Despite achieving a record high of 1512 million tonnes of cargo transported during the fiscal year 2022-23, representing an increase from 1418 million tonnes in the previous year, Indian Railways currently accounts for less than 30% of India's total cargo movement. The majority of cargo is still transported by road, as per official estimates. Vaishnaw highlighted the progress being made in railway infrastructure development, including the construction of new tracks and the addition of multiple lines to existing ones. He also mentioned the introduction of over 200 new rakes in the past two years, as well as the induction of technologically advanced trains such as the Vande Bharat and Amrit Bharat. While Vande Bharat is a semi-high speed AC service, Amrit Bharat is a push-pull technology non-AC train with advanced features that is expected to be introduced in the coming days. During the event, Vaishnaw recognized the outstanding services of 100 Railway employees from various Zonal Railways, Production Units, and Railway public sector undertakings (PSUs). Regarding India's economic growth, the minister predicted that the country would rise to one of the top three global economies by 2027, up from its current ranking of fifth. Vaishnaw also emphasized the importance of shedding any remnants of a colonial mindset among senior Railway officers, which he believes still influences working methods and practices. He called for a ruthless eradication of these traces of colonial thinking to ensure a modern and efficient railway system.
